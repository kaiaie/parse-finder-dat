# parse-finder.dat

This program reads the `FINDER.DAT` file used by ancient versions of the MacOS 
operating system to store long filename and other metadata on DOS file systems
and dumps its contents to standard output in a format suitable for reading by 
other command-line utilities.

The rationale for creating this utility was finding an archive of ancient floppies 
and Zip disks (!) from the days of MacOS System 7 (!!) that I wished to use on 
Linux. It is of doubtful use to anyone else at this point in time.
